# AI Test

A simple web-based project to test and experiment with artificial intelligence concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Purpose

This project serves as a basic frontend interface for experimenting with AI models or simulating AI-related behaviors directly in the browser. It can act as a testing platform or a proof-of-concept for machine learning or artificial intelligence ideas using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – For page structure  
- **CSS** – For styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – For interaction and AI logic  
- **Netlify** – For deployment and hosting  

## Project Structure
```
ai_test/
├── index.html        # Main HTML page
├── style.css         # Styling for the UI
├── script.js         # AI logic and interactivity
├── functions/        # Additional helper files or functions
└── netlify.toml      # Netlify deployment configuration
```



## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Mhmd7-7/ai_test.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in the browser.

## Notes

- This is a work-in-progress demo project.  
- No external libraries are currently used, but libraries like TensorFlow.js can be integrated for more advanced AI capabilities.
