# AI Test

A simple web-based project to test and experiment with artificial intelligence concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project serves as a basic frontend interface for experimenting with AI models or simulating AI-related behaviors directly in the browser. It can act as a testing platform or a proof-of-concept for machine learning or artificial intelligence ideas using JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – For page structure  
- **CSS** – For styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – For interaction and AI logic  
- **Netlify** – For deployment and hosting
